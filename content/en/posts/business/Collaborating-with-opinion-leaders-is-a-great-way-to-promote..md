Fortunately, these influencers are also much cheaper to partner with than the prominent super-influencers. Often, they are not even aware of their influence, or they donâ€™t necessarily see it as a monetizable activity. While I recommend you still offer them reasonable compensation, you can approach niche influencers as potential partners instead of just seeing them as a marketing channel.
