You do what people need or want, and then you get paid for it. Some people earn more because they do it better. Superstars make much more money than regular actors, even though the latter may have the same talent as the former. When people choose which movies to watch in the cinema, they tend to be attracted by superstars. Of course, making things that people need is not the only way to make money. Robbing banks, extorting bribes, and monopolizing markets can also bring in money, and these methods are often used by some wealthy individuals. However, these means do not represent all wealth, nor are they the main cause of income inequality. The difference in skills among individuals leads to differences in income, which is the primary reason for income inequality, just like Occam's Razor principle in logic states: the simplest explanation is the best one.
