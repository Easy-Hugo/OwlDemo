Find the critical problem where people need to do the same thing over and over again.

A Critical Problem Occurs Frequently and Repeatedly The reason why critical problems are always on the minds of your customers is that the problems happen so often. Every day, every week, every month, the critical problems repeatedly occur. For your customers, it's always the most urgent thing at that time. The issue needs to be solved there and then, every single time. If it's not frequent, it is likely not a critical problem. If it occurs repeatedly and isn't easily solved, it is likely to be a critical problem.
