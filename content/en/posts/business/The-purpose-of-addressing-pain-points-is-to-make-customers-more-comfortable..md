A good question here is, "At what stage of your workflow will you be using this solution?"

Throughout your solution validation conversations, you want to project a clear interest in solving your customerâ€™s problems without causing new ones. If you communicate this clearly in each call, you will create goal alignment between you and your prospect: you both want a great solution that makes things easier for the customer.
