There's a joke that every SaaS product is essentially an Excel spreadsheet turned into business logic. When someone uses generic tools such as word processors or spreadsheets to solve a problem, it indicates that the problem is significant enough to warrant building specialized tools. Most problems aren't highly complex and can often be resolved immediately. However, a critical issue will require developing a more sophisticated system. If your customers are using piles of Post-it notes or a disorganized mix of Word and Excel files to address a problem, you might have identified a key pain point.
