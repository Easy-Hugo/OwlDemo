I believe that one of the key points to making money is reputation and credibility. In other words, people need to know you and trust you so that they can transact through you. I mentioned earlier about divers as an example. Because your diving skills are excellent and you have high visibility, treasure hunters will come to you on their own initiative and share some treasures with you in exchange for your skills.
