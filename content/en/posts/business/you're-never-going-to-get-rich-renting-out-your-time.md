Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you're accountable on your output, as opposed to your input— that's the dream. A leveraged worker can out-produce a non-leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.
