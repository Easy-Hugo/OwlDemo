Big goals are easier to achieve than small ones because problems cannot completely block your view of the big picture. Successful people always know how to put themselves in a "necessary" situation; without achieving their goals, they will never be happy. When you set limits for yourself, you will try to reach those limits. You should not only take responsibility for your failures but also for your successes. If you believe that success is unrepeatable, you lose the opportunity to improve your self-worth. A person who gives 110% effort and actively eliminates all excuses is bound to succeed. You need a good coach, someone who can maximize your potential using their own experience. The first person to focus on their weaknesses will not gain wealth. Whether it's passive defense or active offense in a competition makes a world of difference. Many people have lost the joy of life and the opportunity to become wealthy by trying too hard to eliminate their weaknesses. The price you must pay to acquire wealth is time. But this is not comparable to the time you earn through wealth. Wealth allows you to think calmly about the meaning of life without financial concerns.
